Look at this Ruby code:

  class MyClass; end
	obj1 = MyClass.new
	obj2 = MyClass.new

Then look at the paper printout you received (it's the same image that you can see here in missing_lines.jpg). It shows some of the connections between the entities in the program.

Now it’s your turn to add more lines and boxes to the diagram and answer these questions:

1. What’s the class of Object?

2. What’s the superclass of Module?

3. What’s the class of Class?

4. Imagine that you execute this code:

	 		obj3 = MyClass.new
	 		obj3.instance_variable_set("@x", 10)

   Can you add obj3 to the diagram?

You can use irb (or Pry) and the Ruby documentation to find out the answers. As you answer the questions above, add the missing lines and boxes to the diagram.

1.Class
2.Object
3.Class
